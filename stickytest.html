			<p>Tokyo (東京, Tōkyō) is Japan's capital and the world's most populous metropolis. It is also one of Japan's 47 prefectures, consisting of 23 central city wards and multiple cities, towns and villages west of the city center. The Izu and Ogasawara Islands are also part of Tokyo.</p>
			<p>Prior to 1868, Tokyo was known as Edo. A small castle town in the 16th century, Edo became Japan's political center in 1603 when Tokugawa Ieyasu established his feudal government there. A few decades later, Edo had grown into one of the world's most populous cities. With the Meiji Restoration of 1868, the emperor and capital moved from Kyoto to Edo, which was renamed Tokyo ("Eastern Capital"). Large parts of Tokyo were destroyed in the Great Kanto Earthquake of 1923 and in the air raids of 1945.</p>
			<p>Today, Tokyo offers a seemingly unlimited choice of shopping, entertainment, culture and dining to its visitors. The city's history can be appreciated in districts such as Asakusa and in many excellent museums, historic temples and gardens. Contrary to common perception, Tokyo also offers a number of attractive green spaces in the city center and within relatively short train rides at its outskirts.</p>
			<p>Tokyo has a humid subtropical climate with hot summers and mild winters. Japan as a whole has four distinct seasons, with spring landing from March to May, summer from June to August, autumn from September through November, and winter from December to February.</p>
			<p>Annual rainfall in Tokyo averages approximately 60 inches, with a wetter summer and a drier winter. Snowfall usually occurs annually in Tokyo, albeit sporadic.</p>
			<p>Spring is arguably the best time to visit Tokyo, for Japan’s magnificent cherry blossoms bloom in abundance during this season. In spring, temperatures are mild and ideal for touring the city outdoors and on foot.</p>
			<p>If you’re traveling to Tokyo specifically to visit Mt. Fuji, though, the best time to visit would be from July to mid-September, when temperatures are pleasant and the mountain is free of snow. The only downside to visiting Tokyo during summer months is that this is the season when the capital city sees the most rainfall.</p>
			<p>It doesn’t matter what you’re eating: eel, sushi, noodles, sweets, cocktails. Small establishments are where shokunin do their work. It may be intimidating to walk into a six-seat bar, but this is where you will find the good stuff—a place where the chef and the staff (most likely husband and wife) are unwaveringly dedicated to their craft. The most exclusive places require an invitation or a Japanese guest to accompany you, but the city is bursting with warm, intimate establishments dying for a chance to blow your mind.</p>
			<p>Tokyo is taking its role as the host of the 2020 summer games very seriously. That means billions of dollars of investment in infrastructure, much of it geared to making the city more attractive to the rest of the world. Major additions to the railways systems, a rising tide of high-end hotels, aggressive makeovers of the city’s tourist hubs, and a surge in menus and signs in English are all are part of cementing Tokyo’s image as a world-class destination. The Japanese government has high expectations that Olympics will launch Tokyo and the rest of the country into a new tourism stratosphere (in 2016, Japan was only the fifth most-visited country in Asia); if they’re right, book your tickets now and take it all in before the world is the wiser.</p>
